## Overview
- Our code is organized in two files:
  * `graph.py`: definition of the class Graph along with graph-related functions
  * `tree.py`: definition of the class Tree along with tree traversal functions

- Implemented functions: 
1. degree
2. neighbors
3. components
4. path
5. spanning_tree 6. prim
7. kruskal
8. dijkstra
9. shortest_path
10. preorder
11. postorder

## Setup
Create a python environment using conda and the `environment.yaml` file:
```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```
All analysis steps are provided in more detail in the `Report.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Run it with the following command from the source folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

If you are not using any python environment, you need to install some python packages in `requirements.txt` file
